BLACK SALT - sea salt, charcoal (from fire is best), black pepper, incense ashes, mortar & pestle; grind the pepper and charcoal into a fine powder then add salt slowly, then use the salt as a bed to burn incense; once the incense is burned out, mix the ashes into the salt then store in an airtight container.
  To use, either hide a small bag at the workplace to absorb anger, moodiness, and gossip.  Or sprinkle under the bed (or keep next to bed) to ward away nightmares.  Or sprinkle behind an unwanted guest to cause them to leave.  Or add to floor washes before cleaning your home to send away negativity and bad spirits.  Can be used to casting circles.  BE CAREFUL, AS THE CHARCOAL WILL STAIN.
WAR WATER - iron nails, moss, pond/swamp water; let the moss and nails sit in a glass jar full of swamp/pond water, only opening it to let in oxygen during the first week - it is ready when the moss has completely decomposed and the nails have rusted thoroughly.
  To use, you break the jar at the feet of your enemy (or on their land), but you could also pour it on their land or sprinkle them with it - as protection, you could sprinkle some around your own land.
